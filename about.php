The ministries’ mission shall be to promote doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ, through the teaching of the Holy Bible by changing life through His teaching and imparting people’s life positively through having faith by accepting his teaching and incorporating it into our lifestyle all over the world.  
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
           Loving God with all your heart shall be an obligation before the Associations will teach people about the importance of loving God with all your heart. Mark 12:30 “And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength”.  Deuteronomy 6:4-6 “Listen, O Israel! The lord is our God, the lord alone.  And you must love the lord your God with all your heart, soul, and strength.  And you must commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these commands that I am giving you today. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Forgiveness shall be taught by the Church through the Holy Bible. People shall have depth knowledge about what the scripture says about forgiveness of sin. 1 John 1:9 “if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness”. Also, the bible made us to understand that Proverbs 17:9 “Love prospers when a fault is forgiven but dwelling on it separates close friends”.  This shall be an obligation for the Church to let people know the importance of forgiveness.  This shall be used as well to counsel people and to resolve disputes.
 
        </li>
        <li>
            		Prayers is also one of the foundational factors of the Church, in which the Church shall promote, for people to know the importance of prayers. I John 5:14” And we are confident that he hears us whenever we ask for anything that pleases him”.
        </li>
        <li>
            	Love your Neighbour: Unifying people through the teaching and evangelising the gospel of Jesus Christ, how important it is for people to dwell among each other. 1 Corinthians 1:10 “ I appeal to you brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought”. Philippian 2:2 “Then make my joy complete by being like-minded having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind”.
        </li>
    </ul>
        
    
</p>
</div>
           
           <div class="col-md-6">
          <ul>
        <li>
            Evangelism is the bedrock of Christianity; the Church shall embark on evangelism because Jesus wants through believers/Church to preach his gospel through outreach.  The spirit of Christianity is higher than legalism, and it is of the spirit of legalism to press injunctions of courses of action where the underlying principles of action are unseen or unfelt. Every man that does the work of God that promote peace through evangelism shall be called children of God. Matthew 5:9 “God blesses those who work for peace, for they will be called the children of God”.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repentance of sin shall be taught by the Church through the Holy Bible, as the scriptures says in Acts 3:19 “Repent, then and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord”.  Also, in Luke 17:3 – 4 “So watch yourselves. If your brother or sister sins against you rebuke them: and if they repent, forgive them.  Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them”.
        </li>
        <li>
            While as many people are allowed to join the Church on her weekly services meetings, so many are hereby welcome and if they wish to become member, a membership forms will be given out for records accountabilities. Hebrews 10:25 “And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another especially not that the day of his return is drawing near”.
        </li>
        <li>
            	The Church shall enhance these missionary obligations by providing information through teaching, printing tracts, meetings, conferences, etc. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Every conference and other outreach event organised by the Church by creating awareness through advertisements, flyers, and networking.
        </li>
        <li>
            There shall be a forum to create awareness for all members who need support to enhance their knowledge in knowing God or believing in our Lord Jesus Christ.
        </li>
        <li>
            	Counselling and advice shall be given to helps those who needs them from time to time through the spiritual heads or through professionals based on the situations at hand. This will be enhanced spiritual and moral being of her members.
